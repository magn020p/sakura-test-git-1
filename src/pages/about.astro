            <h2>It all started with a Cherry Blossom</h2>
            <p>
              The original idea came from the noble deed of donation of 200
              cherry blossom (Sakura) trees by Mr. Seiichi Takaki, President of
              Andersen Institute of Bread & Life, the holding company of
              Andersen Group of Hiroshima City, and the employees of the
              company.
            </p>
            <p>
              The donated trees were planted in Langelinie Park. Mr. Takaki is
              Honorary Consul of Denmark and he was appointed to the honorable
              position of ambassador of H.C. Andersen on the occasion of the
              200th anniversary of H.C. Andersen's birthday in 2005. The donated
              Sakura trees were planted in Langelinie Park.

            <h2>The magic of Sakura Trees</h2>
            <p>
              In Japan people love and admire Sakura blossom and almost
              everybody go out to enjoy its beauty together with families,
              friends, lovers, office-mates and so forth wherever and whenever
              Sakura bloom. Once a year Sakura connects people and people meet
              people under Sakura trees. It is also the utmost and fundamental
              goal of the Committee.
